With increasing technical advancements the world is becoming digital at a high pace and everything is happening online. 
With everything turning online, the risk of cybercrimes and privacy breaches is also increasing. Passwords play a huge role in keeping your data safe online as well as offline platforms.
Considering the traditional username-password authentication, the alphanumeric passwords are either easy to guess or difficult to remember. Alternative authentication methods, such as biometrics, graphical passwords are used to overcome these problems associated with the traditional username-password authentication technique.
In a graphical password authentication system, the user has to select from images, in a specific order, presented to them in a graphical user interface (GUI). According to a study, the human brain has a greater capability of remembering what they see(pictures) rather than alphanumeric characters. Therefore, graphical passwords overcome the disadvantage of alphanumeric passwords.
